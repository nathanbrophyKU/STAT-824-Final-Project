# What Factors Contribute to Crime in 1960
This repository stores all materials related to the STAT 824 final project. Within this repository you will find two main files: (1) the R Shiny app code and (2) the Crime data used in the application.

Additionally, more information about the authors of the dataset and source material can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilpagopal/us-crime-dataset!

*REMINDER: If you are downloading the app and data files, make sure to load the data locally on your computer before loading the application in R (i.e., replace my line loading the data with your own). I've tried (and failed) to work out a solution where you could load the data file directly from GitHub, but the package "RCurl" and the function getURL, which allow you to do just that, do not seem to work for PC users because the package has not been updated and/or taken care of.*
